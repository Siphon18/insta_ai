-   **üë§ Persona Generation**: Enter any public Instagram username to create an AI persona. The AI will adopt the user's name, bio, and attempt to match their personality.
-   **üí¨ Text Chat**: A classic chat interface for conversing with the generated AI persona.
-   **üé§ Voice Chat**: An immersive, full-screen voice chat experience. Speak to the AI and hear its responses in a synthesized voice.
-   **üó£Ô∏è Voice Selection**: Choose a specific voice for the AI or let it auto-detect the best voice based on the profile's gender cues.
-   **üñºÔ∏è Dynamic Profile Display**: The chat interface displays the Instagram user's profile picture, name, bio, and selected voice.
-   **üöÄ Built with Modern Tools**: Powered by Google's Gemini for intelligent and context-aware chat responses and Murf.ai for realistic text-to-speech.

## ü§î How It Works

1.  **Enter Username**: You start by providing an Instagram username on the "Add Username" page.
2.  **Fetch Profile**: The backend server uses an Instagram API to fetch the public profile information of the user, including their full name, bio, and profile picture.
3.  **Generate Persona**: This information is then passed to the Google Gemini model with a carefully crafted prompt, instructing it to act as an AI chatbot that mimics the personality of that user.
4.  **Confirm Persona**: The fetched profile details are displayed for your confirmation.
5.  **Start Chatting**: Once confirmed, you can start a conversation with the AI persona through either a text-based or a voice-based interface. The chat history is maintained within your session.
